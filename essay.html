      <h1>Narrative Visualization Essay</h1>

      <h2>Messaging</h2>
      <p>
        This interactive visualization tells the story of Charles Messier, an
        18th century astronomer. He had a dream of becoming one of the greatest
        discoverers of comets. By the end of his life, he discovered 13 comets,
        but the world doesn't remember him by his discoveries.
      </p>

      <p>
        The central question answered by the visualization is why was Messier's
        contribution so important, and what did he find which was so valuable?
      </p>

      <p>
        In the quest to be able to spot comets better, he had meticulously
        maintained a detailed list of celestial objects which were not comets.
        This list came to be known as the <strong>Messier Catalog</strong> - a
        first of its kind list with the most accurate observations of 110
        prominent deep-sky objects, which formed a backbone of future astronomy.
        This project will try to bring this answer to the fore by the use of
        data.
      </p>

      <h2>Narrative Structure</h2>
      <p>
        This story follows the <strong>Martini Glass</strong> structure, where
        the readers are lead through the whole story, and at the end they are
        left to explore the data presented to them as they see fit. The first 3
        charts offer just the visualization - of Messier's discoveries, as well
        as his two published lists. The last chart lets users interact with the
        final chart and view each object in detail.
      </p>

      <h2>Visual Structure</h2>
      <p>
        The text-based story is based on a linear visual structure. Each
        visualization is also connected by the common theme of Messier's
        lifetime and the years his observations and discoveries were made in.
        The catalog visualizations also have the year highlighted in bold so
        that the user has a sense of which data point relates to which year of
        discovery.
      </p>

      <h2>Scenes</h2>
      <p>
        The four scenes follow one overarching theme in this visualization - to
        chart the story of Messier. It follows a chronological path through his
        life, and presents the relevant data when the readers have been informed
        about significant moments of his life. The scenes are as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Messier's discoveries or co-discoveries of comets.</li>
        <li>
          A chronological mapping of each object observed by Messier and
          recorded in his first published list.
        </li>
        <li>
          A chronological mapping of each object observed by Messier and
          recorded in his second published list.
        </li>
        <li>
          A chronological mapping of all objects observed by Messier and
          attributed to him.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Annotations</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The first chart (comets) has annotations which highlight the period
          during which Messier recorded all the observations in his Catalog. The
          lines have the same colour as the object he recorded in his catalog
          (the Crab Nebula and M110).
        </li>
        <li>
          The second, third and fourth charts have the year annotation on the
          bottom right, which shows the year of discovery of the items popping
          up on the chart.
        </li>
        <li>
          The second, third and fourth charts (Catalog charts) have the year
          annotation on the bottom right, which shows the year of discovery of
          the items popping up on the chart.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Parameters</h2>
      <p>The visualizations work on two parameters</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          which <strong>aspect</strong> is shown on each chart - the discovery
          of comets, or the observations of the Messier objects.
        </li>
        <li>the year of the discovery/observation.</li>
        <li>
          the Messier Catalog <strong>publication number</strong> (1774, 1781,
          or the full list) of the chart.
        </li>
        <li>
          To <strong>draw</strong> the chart elements or not? Only when the user
          has scrolled a significant portion of the chart into view does the
          drawing start.
        </li>
        <li>
          To <strong>allow user interaction</strong> for the chart or not? Only
          once the user scrolls past the last chart do all charts become
          interactive.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The visualizations have these states:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>interactivity</strong> - once the reader has read through to
          the end of the article, the interactivity state is set to
          <code>true</code>, and after that, the reader can interact with any of
          the visualizations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>publication year</strong> - Messier published two lists, and
          the last two visualizations show different list data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>tooltip shown</strong> - once interactivity is enabled, the
          viewer can click on data points on the chart, and these actions fire
          of events which show tooltips with relevant data for each data point.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Triggers</h2>
      <p>
        The scroll is used to trigger off the interactivity and publication
        year, and the user click controls the tooltip shown state.
      </p>
      <p>
        To guide the reader towards the content, animations are used when the
        reader has scrolled atleast 50% into a chart's area. The
        <strong>cursor</strong> also turns into a <strong>pointer</strong> to
        indicate to the reader that they can click the chart's data points for
        more data.
