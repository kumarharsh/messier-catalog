      <h1>The Messier Catalog</h1>

      <p class="intro">
        April 10<sup>th</sup>, 2019 &mdash; the day a fuzzy, unremarkable image
        of a circular ring took the world by storm. Except this image was
        nothing like anything else. In fact, this was an image of an object
        which was never seen before. And yet, here it was in all it's blurry
        glory - the <strong>Black Hole</strong>
        at the center of the M87 Galaxy.

      <p>
        The M87 Galaxy, or <em>Virgo A</em> as it's more commonly known is a
        distant galaxy some 54 million light years away. Today, we have enough
        advanced equipments and people to make such fascinating observations of
        the furthest reaches of our universe. Every discovery is heralded as a
        new frontier for science and humanity, every new successful observation
        rightfully lauded as advancing our understanding of the universe. But
        what of the failures? For every successful experiment, there are
        countless failed ones &mdash; hours upon hours seemingly spent in vain
        chasing illusions in the vast space. As the saying goes,
        <q>Nobody remembers failures</q>. But there was such a failure
        <em>everyone</em> remmebers. Even you read about it - right at the
        beginning of this paragraph. It's the <strong>M</strong> in M87. What is
        the <strong>M</strong>, and why do we use it?
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's go back some 250 years, when a great way to make a name for
        yourself involved doing nothing other than staring at the sky.
        Astronomers and hobbyists were obsessed with discovering comets. You
        might remember some astronomers just by the piece of rock they found -
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet" target="_blank"
          >Edmond Halley</a
        >
        being a prime example<a href="#ref-halley" class="ref"></a>. One such
        astronomer was a guy named Charles Messier. Charles' interest in comets
        was stimulated by the sighting of the spectacular six-tailed comet in
        1744. Little did he know that the comet would change his life forever.
      </p>

      <h2>Discoveries & Failure</h2>

      <p class="intro">
        To pursue his interest, Charles became an understudy of a French Navy
        astronomer in 1751, and started keeping detailed observations of
        everything he saw in the sky. He co-discovered his first comet in 1758,
        and made his first independent discovery in 1760. In total, he
        discovered or co-discovered 20 or 21 comets (depending on the sources).
        Here's a list of all the comets, along with their observation times,
        spread across Charles' lifetime.
      </p>

      <figure class="chart">
        <svg id="comets"></svg>
        <figcaption>

          lines demarcate the time period in which the Messier Catalog
          was made.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        As he made progress though, he was constantly frustrated by spotting
        objects that <em>looked like comets</em> but weren't. So he decided to
        make a list. He added all the "definitely not comets but look like
        comets" objects he observed from his 4″ telescope in Paris. His list
        grew and grew to 45 objects which he published in 1774. The objects he
        observed and recorded till the first publication are shown below.
      </p>

      <figure class="chart">
        <svg id="catalog-list1"></svg>

          in the celestial coordinates across a silhouette of our Milky Way.

      </figure>

      <p>
        Bit by bit, this catalog became his go-to
        <em>"objects to ignore while looking in the sky"</em> list. With time,
        the list grew even bigger, and by 1781, it had burgeoned to include 103
        objects. 7 other objects were added to the list in the 20<sup>th</sup>
        century as they were determined to have been discovered by him but never
        published. The current, and hopefully final, list now stands at 110
        objects.

        <svg id="catalog-list2"></svg>

      </figure>

      <h2>A Higher Purpose</h2>

      <p class="intro">
        By the end, Charles Messier laid sole claim to 13 comets &mdash; not an
        insignificant achievement in itself. But his lasting legacy to the world
        of astronomy is the <strong>Messier Catalog</strong>. It has become so
        popular that the objects in the Messier Catalog are still used by
        professional and amateur astronomers today and in early spring in
        Europe, astronomers sometimes gather for "Messier marathons", when all
        of the objects can be viewed over a single night. The study of these
        objects by astronomers has led, and continues to lead, to important,
        incredible discoveries such as the life cycles of stars, the reality of
        galaxies as separate 'island universes,' and the possible age of the
        universe. The Messier Catalog has been far more influential on the
        succeeding two and a half years of astronomy than his comets could ever
        be.
      </p>

      <p>
        The list has a very special place in astronomy and history. In his quest
        to catalog all the boring non-Comet objects he might be fooled by,
        Charles Messier inadvertantly created the
        <strong>first</strong> comprehensive and reliable list of galaxies and
        star clusters in the world. His observations were very accurate, and he
        included the correct positions of each object in our sky. The world's
        most beautiful nebulae and other
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep-sky_object" target="_blank"
          >deep sky objects</a
        >
        can be found in the Messier Catalog.
