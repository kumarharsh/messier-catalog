      <h1>Narrative Visualization Essay</h1>

      <h2>Messaging</h2>
      <p>
        This interactive visualization tells the story of Charles Messier, and
        highlights his discoveries, and why his observations have become to be
        more famous than any of his discoveries.
      </p>

      <h2>Narrative Structure</h2>
      <p>
        This story follows the <strong>Martini Glass</strong> structure, where
        the readers are lead through the whole story, and at the end they are
        left to explore the data as they see fit. The first 2 charts offer just
        the visualization, but the last chart lets users interact with the chart
        and view each object in detail.
      </p>

      <h2>Visual Structure</h2>
      <p>
        The text-based story gives a narrative structure to the visualization.
        Each visualization is also connected by the common theme of Messier's
        lifetime and the years his observations and discoveries were made in.
        The catalog visualizations also have the year highlighted in bold so
        that the user has a sense of which data point relates to which year of
        discovery.
      </p>

      <h2>Scenes</h2>
      <p>
        There is only one overarching scene in this visualization - that is the
        story of Messier. It follows a chronological path through his life, and
        presents the relevant data when the readers have been informed about
        significant moments of his life.
      </p>

      <h2>Annotations</h2>
      <p>
        The first chart (comets) has annotations which highlight the period
        during which Messier recorded all the observations in his Catalog. The
        lines have the same colour as the object he recorded in his catalog (the
        Crab Nebula and M110).
      </p>

      <h2>Parameters</h2>
      <p>The visualizations work on two parameters</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          which aspect is shown - the discovery phase, or the observation phase.
        </li>
        <li>the year of the discovery/observation.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The visualizations have these states:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>interactivity</strong> - once the reader has read through to
          the end of the article, the interactivity state is set to
          <code>true</code>, and after that, the reader can interact with any of
          the visualizations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>publication year</strong> - Messier published two lists, and
          the last two visualizations show different list data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>tooltip shown</strong> - once interactivity is enabled, the
          viewer can click on data points on the chart, and these actions fire
          of events which show tooltips with relevant data for each data point.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Triggers</h2>
      <p>
        The scroll is used to trigger off the interactivity and publication
        year, and the user click controls the tooltip shown state.
      </p>
      <p>
        To guide the reader towards the content, animations are used when the
        reader has scrolled atleast 50% into a chart's area. The
        <strong>cursor</strong> also turns into a <strong>pointer</strong> to
        indicate to the reader that they can click the chart's data points for
        more data.
